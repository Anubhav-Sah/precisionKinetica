## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14+)
- npm (comes with Node.js)

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Anubhav-Sah/precisionKinetica.git
   cd precisionKinetica


2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Running the App

Start the development server:

```bash
npm start
```

Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to view the app.
The page will hot-reload on file changes, and any lint errors will show up in the console. ([GitHub][1])

---

## Available Scripts

These scripts are generated by Create React App and can be used as follows:

* `npm start` — Launches the app in development mode.
* `npm test` — Runs tests in interactive watch mode. ([GitHub][1])
* `npm run build` — Bundles the app into static files for production, output in the `build/` folder. ([GitHub][1])
* `npm run eject` — Permanently removes the Create React App configuration, letting you fully customize build tools like Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc. ([GitHub][1])

---

## Deployment

*(Describe your deployment strategy. For example:)*
This app can be deployed easily to hosting platforms like **Vercel** or **Netlify**.

* **Build the app:**

  ```bash
  npm run build
  ```
* **Deploy** the generated `build/` folder.

You can preview a live version at: [precision-kinetica-chi.vercel.app](https://precision-kinetica-chi.vercel.app/) ([GitHub][1])

### Next Steps
- **Review & Update Content:** Customize key placeholders, especially the project description, features, deployment details, and license.
- **Extend Documentation:** If your project evolves, consider adding sections like "Testing", "Environment Variables", or "Troubleshooting".
- **Client-oriented Docs:** When you're ready, I can also help create a user-friendly guide explaining how to use the site (e.g., navigating UI, admin workflows).

Let me know if you’d like me to refine the README further or convert it into another format for your client!
